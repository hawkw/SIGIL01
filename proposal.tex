\maketitle
To subvert the form of a three-dimensional object, I intend to convert it into a two-dimensional animation which echoes its visual characteristics. With the addition of motion over time, the work still has a third dimension, but that dimension has become spatial rather than temporal. Removing an object from the physical space it inhabits is, perhaps, the ultimate act of decontextualisation. Once removed from its physical form, a thing ceases to be an object and becomes a symbol of itself.

The objects I will deconstruct in this manner are ferrite-cored copper coils from the high-frequency transformer in a computer power supply unit. I will create two animated Processing sketches. The first will be a stylised depiction of a coil, while the second will be a deconstruction of the coil into its formal elements, a sigilisation. I'm considering the possibility that one or both of these pieces will include an interactive element, affording the viewer some form of influence or control over the object's progress through the temporal dimension.
